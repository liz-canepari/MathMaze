# Overview

This project is an educational maze game designed to enhance my skills as a software engineer while creating an engaging and interactive learning experience. The game challenges players to navigate through a maze, solve math problems to open doors, and reach the goal to win. This project showcases my ability to design interactive applications, implement dynamic game mechanics, and use object-oriented programming principles.

How to Play:

Use the arrow keys to move your player through the maze.
Encounter doors and solve math problems to unlock them.
Reach the goal to win the game!
The purpose of writing this software is to practice and refine my programming skills, including user interaction, graphical rendering, and game logic, while producing a project that is both functional and educational.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

This project was developed using the following tools and technologies:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Arcade for graphics and game logic

# Useful Websites

* [Arcade Library Documentation](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/)
* [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)

# Future Work
Here are some features and improvements I plan to work on:

* Enhance Gameplay: Add multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
* Add Sound Effects: Include background music and sound effects for a more immersive experience.
* Save/Load Functionality: Allow players to save their progress and return later.
* Improve Problem Generation: Make math problems more diverse and adaptive to the playerâ€™s skill level.
* Polish Graphics: Enhance the visual design of the maze and player animations.
